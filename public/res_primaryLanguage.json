I have a background in Project Coordinator thanks to my time as a üì°sattelite communications coodinator üõ∞Ô∏è in the military. I also have a degree in Digital Video Production üé•, thanks to the Seattle Film Institute. I am creative at heart and when I'm not spending time with my two beautiful üêàkittiesüêà‚Äç‚¨õ, I'm usually volunteering at a makerspace üõ†Ô∏è, passing on what little skills I have. I am a quick learner, great team player and pretty funny, if I can so so myself",
